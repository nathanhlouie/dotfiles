# So... what worked?
- Emacs is discoverable, it's easy to find what you're looking for with `describe-function` or `describe-key` along with Vertico and Marginalia.
- I really like Vertico and Marginalia and Consult and that whole stack

# And what didn't work?
- There doesn't feel like a good LSP solution (Eglot vs lsp-mode)
- Discoverability is only good when still learning
- Dependencies and package management still feels complicated even after long use

# What now?
- Moving back to Neovim
- This config will still be found in the commit history, but it is going to be gone :(
